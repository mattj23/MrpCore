/* Determining the WIP history and future for a part
 *
 * Operations which already have results on them are effectively ordered by the results, rather than any other
 * mechanism. Operations which have successful results may be removed from the to-do list of operations (is this true
 * with the corrective looping mechanism?).
 *
 * For operations which have not been attempted, they appear in the to-do list in the sequence of their operation
 * number.  For operations which have failed, what happens next is based on the failure behavior of the master route
 * operation.  Operations with permissible retry are simply stuck on that operation until they get a passing attempt.
 * Operations with corrective chains need to load the chain into the unit's route and the next operation is the
 * first operation in the chain.
 *
 * At the end of a corrective chain, there has to be additional special behavior depending on whether we retry the
 * original failing operation or move on.
 *
 * The main properties of a WIP state are:
 *  > Is the unit completed?
 *  > If not, what's the next operation that needs to be attempted?
 *  > What are the currently active explicit states?
 *  > What was the result of the last attempted operation
 *
