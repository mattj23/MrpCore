/* This file demonstrates a functioning inheritance structure which is usable with the EFCore database context and
 * the other MRP tools.
 *
 * Each custom class inherits from the base type and adds something new to it, modeling how additional concepts and
 * data can be added to the core model without losing the functionality built into the base classes.  Also added is
 * an Operator class, which is also added to the database.
 *
 * MrpCore is intended to be a data model and tools for a MRP system's *core* functionality, namely tracing product
 * items through a production route. Anything which is outside of that core feature set should be added through
 * extending the base classes. For instance, there are many ways to store and handle the concept of an operator, which
 * may make sense in some MRP systems and not in others. MrpCore's philosophy is to *not* implement this directly, but
 * to leave it easy to add without breaking core features.
